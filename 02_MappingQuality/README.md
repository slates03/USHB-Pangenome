# Honey bee pangenome highlights structural variation and diversity of commercial stocks

The Apis mellifera genome is the most widely used resource in honey bee genetics and is due for a major update. Its current structure is a linear composite, with a single individual comprising most of the sequence. It contains biases and errors within a framework that does not represent commercial honey bee genomic variation. A high-quality reference with commercial representation of common variants, including single-nucleotide variants, structural variants and functional elements, is needed. We aim to create a more sophisticated and complete honey bee reference genome with a graph-based, telomere-to-telomere representation of genomic diversity. Here we leverage innovations in technology and study design with the goal of constructing the highest-possible quality honey beekeeper pangenome reference. 
Honey bee pangenome was produced from six commercial stocks in the United States. We found aligning the pangenome increased mapping quality. Additionally, SVs called with the pangenome was higher than those called with Delly. Using SVs and SNPs called with the pangenome, the six honey bee stocks experience genetic differentiation and high genetic diversity.  These SVs were also distributed across the genome and found in different regions. SVs were also unique to some stocks. Finally, we found SVs unique to Pol-line are associated with selection compared to the Italian stock. Overall, this honey bee pangenome reference contains more accurate and diverse representation of commercial genomic variation, allowing improve geneâ€“disease association studies across populations, expanding the scope of genomics research to the most repetitive and polymorphic regions of the genome, and serving as a valuable genetic resource for future breeding.
